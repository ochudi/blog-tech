Being a software developer isn’t just about writing code—it’s about evolving, staying curious, and constantly learning. In my case, that means balancing multiple roles: working as a developer at three companies, advising at a prestigious school, taking on freelance gigs, and still making time to explore new ideas in tech, philosophy, and beyond.  

It’s not always easy, but learning while working has become a core part of my journey.  

## **Why Learning Never Stops**  

Technology moves fast. What’s cutting-edge today might be outdated in a few years. To stay ahead, I’ve built a mindset where learning isn’t a separate activity—it’s part of my daily workflow. Whether it’s diving into a new framework, refining my problem-solving skills, or even exploring deeper topics like **systems thinking and philosophy**, every day presents an opportunity to grow.  

## **How I Stay Sharp While Managing Multiple Roles**  

### **1. Learning Through Work**  
Each project I take on—whether at a company, as an advisor, or in freelance—teaches me something new. I see work as an extension of learning, where solving real-world problems pushes me to develop new skills and perspectives.  

### **2. Prioritizing the Right Knowledge**  
Not all information is equally valuable. I focus on learning that **aligns with my goals**, whether that’s mastering advanced frontend architectures, understanding distributed systems, or deep-diving into **how humans think and interact with technology**.  

### **3. Structuring My Time for Growth**  
With multiple commitments, time is my most valuable resource. I carve out dedicated slots for focused learning—whether it’s reading, experimenting with a new tool, or even engaging in deeper discussions about topics outside of tech. The key is consistency, even if it’s just **30 minutes a day**.  

## **Beyond Tech: Learning for the Bigger Picture**  

While tech is my core focus, I’ve realized that **broad knowledge fuels deeper understanding**. Exploring philosophy, psychology, and history helps me **think critically, make better decisions, and build more intuitive software**. These insights shape how I approach problem-solving and innovation.  

## **What’s Next?**  

I’m always looking to expand my perspective—whether it’s picking up a new framework, understanding how the **next wave of AI will impact development**, or diving deeper into **human-centered design**.  

If you’re also balancing learning with a packed schedule, I’d love to hear how you approach it. Let’s connect and exchange ideas!
